**<font color = "red">Note: I plan to graduate in 2025 and I'm mainly looking for the AI Infra Engineer (especially related to the acceleration of Inference or/and Training), Machine Learning Engineering/Researcher, Data Scientist and Quantitative Researcher/Trader opportunities. If you have fantastic PostDoc or finance (like PEVC) opportunities, I'm also glad to have a try.</font>** 

**If you have any suitable positions, feel free to contact [me](mailto:cs.mzr@my.cityu.edu.hk).**	My resume can be found [here](https://mezrua.github.io/files/CV.pdf). 

I'm a fourth-year PhD student under the supervision of [Dr. XU Weitao](https://www.weitaoxu.com/) in the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong. I'm a member of [Smart Sensing and Mobile Computing Lab (S2MC)](http://s2mc.site/index.html). I also work closely with [Dr. CAO Xuanyu](http://eexcao.people.ust.hk/) (ECE in HKUST) and [Dr. SONG Linqi](https://sites.google.com/site/aisquaredlab/about-us/linqi) (CS in CityU). Prior to this, I got my B.Eng. and B.Econ. degree in Computer Science and Financial Engineering at the Wu Yuzhang Honors College, [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/). I also worked as the Quantitave Researcher Intern in one hedge fund and as the AI engineer intern at Huawei 2012 Labs before.

My research interests include distributed machine learning (system), distributed optimization methods and quantitative research.	

I focus on communication-efficient distributed optimization (especially in Federated Learning) and decentralized optimization.
